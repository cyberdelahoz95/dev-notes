4 principles that can guide our development using Angular

### Locate

We want to find or locate quickly a feature or piece of code in our project.

One way to achieve this is by organizing our code by features.

* app
  * about-us
  * contact-us
  * footer

### Identify

Recognize quickly the role a file has.

* header.directive.ts
* header.pipe.ts
* header.service.ts

### Flat

No more than 3 level of folders

### Try DRY

Try as much as you can Do not repeating yourself
